//! [`CustomMatcher`]: how a policy's own label gets detected.
//!
//! A policy can already introduce a label elide does not ship, via
//! [`custom`]. That declares the *vocabulary* — what the thing is
//! called — and nothing more: no recognizer looks for it, so the
//! label is scoped, rules target it, and it never matches. A
//! matcher is the other half, saying how to find it.
//!
//! The split mirrors elide's own: a `Label` is identity, a
//! `Regex`/`Dictionary` is detection. Keeping them apart also
//! leaves room for several matchers per label.
//!
//! [`custom`]: super::PolicyDefinition::custom
