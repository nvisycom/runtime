//! [`Provider`]: a deployment's configuration, ready to build
//! orchestrators from.
//!
//! Configuration is parsed once; an [`Orchestrator`] is built per
//! request, because it carries request data — the policies in
//! force, the caller's scope, a correlation id — that no
//! deployment-wide value could hold. What the provider holds is the
//! half that does not change between requests: the codec registry,
//! the recognizer and enricher lineups, and the key provider.
//!
//! The returned orchestrator borrows the registry from the provider
//! that made it, so a provider outlives every orchestrator it hands
//! out. Hold one for the life of the process.
