//! The engine end to end: `analyze` then `anonymize`, through the
//! same calls a host makes.
//!
//! elide's own pipeline bench covers detection and redaction over a
//! hand-built orchestrator. This one goes through `Engine`, so it
//! also carries what the runtime adds per request: decoding the
//! document, compiling the policy set, recording each entity's
//! policy pick, and re-encoding.
//!
//! The `Engine` is built once, as a deployment would. Each
//! iteration starts from fresh bytes, since anonymize consumes the
//! decoded document. Throughput is the document's byte size, so the
//! figure extrapolates to real documents.
